;
;5.32:  + Fixed a bug when compressing small data streams under certain
;	  conditions. Thanks to Jeffrey Lim for finding and fixing this.
;	+ Included C++ decompressor, CompressedData.cpp/h, written by
;	  Jeffrey Lim.
;
;5.21:
;	+ Added block orientation. Improved compression significantly for
;	  data that is, at any portion(s), uncompressible. For example,
;	  JCALG1 can now compress (slightly) some compressed archives (i.e. zip).
;	+ Jordan Russell contributed delphi interface; see JCALG1.PAS.
;	+ Updated jcalg1_test.
;	
;5.15:
;	+ Included static link library and import library, for static 
;	  and dynamic linking, respectively.
;	+ Fixed stdcall incompatibility with JCALG1_GetInfo and other
;	  exports.
;	+ Included C function prototypes.
;	  
;5.14:
;	+ Added functions GetUncompressedSizeOfCompressedBlock 
;	  and GetNeededBufferSize.
;	+ Memory allocated by user-defined allocation functions
;	  no longer needs to be zero initialized.
;	+ Added word signature, 'JC' at the beginning a compressed
;	  block, followed by a dword indicating the uncompressed
;	  size of the block.
;	+ Jordan Russell added some error handling in cases where
;	  a given memory block could not be allocated.
